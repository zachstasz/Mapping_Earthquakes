# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview

Using JavaScript, we've built a website that will filter data on a map to show all earthquakes that have occurred in the last seven days.

## Results

The map can be filtered to show only major earthquakes and/or tectonic plates.

Using different styles of maps, the information pops!
